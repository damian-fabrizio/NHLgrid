# Summary
-This is a knowledge based game inspired by the popular "Immaculate Grid" found on the SportsReference website.
I put my own unique twist on it by reversing the logic. Traditionally, this type of game features an empty grid with team logos along 
the perimeter, where the user has to match a player to an intersection of two teams. In my version, the user must match a team to an intersection of two players.
This type of game does not exist anywhere online that I am aware of. It is something i decided to create as a challenge. In the below pictures you can see 
the main features of the game. A menu to select an answer, a score and guess tracker, and the ability to start a new game after each previous game is finished.
